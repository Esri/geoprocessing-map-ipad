# geoprocessing--map-ipad

At the 2012 User Conference Lauren Rosenshein Bennett gave a Geoprocessing presentation in which she demonstrated an iPad application.

The demo was developed for the iPad using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS 2.3, xCode 4.4 (with Automatic Reference Counting) and iOS 5.1. The charts were developed using the open source library CorePlot for iOS [here](http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/).
