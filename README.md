At the 2012 User Conference Lauren Rosenshein Bennett gave a Geoprocessing presentation in which she demonstrated an iPad application. 

The demo was developed for the iPad using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS 2.3, xCode 4.4 (with Automatic Reference Counting) and iOS 5.1. The charts were developed using the open source library CorePlot for iOS http://code.google.com/p/core-plot/

For more information about the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS, please visit the Resource Center. If you would like to contact the iOS Development Team to provide feedback on this or any other code sample, please email your questions to iOSDevTeam@esri.com.
